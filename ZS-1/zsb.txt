-> Basics of JS:
    -Program in a running state is known as process.
    -All programs are executed in RAM only.
    -When process is loaded in memory it is allocated some memory by RAM.
    -All piece of information are stored in RAM.


-> KeyWords:
    In programming language some words are reserved by the languages for its own purpose. They have the special meaning or special use case.
    Ex-let, for, function, while,etc.


-> How can we store some values in program?
    To store values we use variables.
        The memory bucket in which values are stored and has its own name.

        -> How to create variables in JS?
            1. Using var KeyWords  : 
                var <variable_name> = value;
            2. Using let KeyWords
                let <variable_name> = value;
            3. Using const KeyWords
                const <variable_name> = value;


        -> Rules for variable creation :-
            1. Variable can contain small alphabets, capital,digits and underscore.
            2. We cant have space or any other special character.
            3. We should always give some meaningful name to the variables.
            4. We can not start the variable name with the digits.
            5. We can not use keywords as variable name.

-> Why we use semicolon?
    one line of js code is equivalent to an instruction. So one complete instruction in js is called statement.
    it is not mandatory in JS. But it is a recommended practice as it differentiates the statements;


-> How to show the data to the user?
    Input------->Function------->Output
    Here to show the data to the user we use the following function :
        console.log("x") --->this function take some data and display it to the user.
        if we have two different console.logs() they print their data in different lines.
        we can also pass multiple values and print them in same line. 

-> What all values we can store in js?
    1. Number - 10,20,30,etc 
    2. String - "Name", 'Name',`Name`
    3. Boolean - true or false
    4. Undefined - Something not defined yet but may be defined later. (let a;)
    5. Object - if we have to somehow store key-value pairs then we use object. <name:King>
    6. Null - It actually represents empty value. (let a= NULL;)



    ex: var marks = 100;
        var name = "ZS";
        var age;
        var company = null;
        console.log("Marks: ", marks);
        console.log("Name: ", name);
        console.log("Age: ", age);
        console.log("Company: ", company);
    Output :
        Marks:  100
        Name:  ZS
        Age:  undefined
        Company:  null


-> Two types of datatype :
    1. Primitive datatype - Types which are atomic in nature.(Number)
    2. Non-Primitive datatype - Types which are the composition of other keys.(Object) it depends on other types.


-> Special characters :
    1. "\n" - Its called escape sequence. It print next line.
    2. "\t" - it prints 4 white spaces.
    3."\\" - to use other special character we use double backslash.


->Comments :
    Comments are a piece of code that is for documentation purpose. Programming languages skips the comment. It has nothing to do with the execution.
    Two types of comment :
        Single line comment - //This is a single line comment
        Multiple line comment - /* this 
                                    is multiline comment*/


-> Operators :
    1. Arithmetic Operators : +,-,*,%,/,**
    2.
